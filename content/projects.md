# PROJECTS

## Working currently

I am working on a CLI tool that extracts translations and translates them through ChatGPT. Building it with Go.

### EDP price simulator

Built a simulator to calculate the monthly electricity bill based on three different plans, each with different prices and specificities. Made with HTML, CSS and vanilla Javascript. Deployed with Netlify.
I really liked this project due to its simple and pragmatic approach.

### Patient Management

Built a management system for patients, with CRUD functionality of patients and observations/notes for each patient. Built with Spring Boot with Spring Data Jpa, Spring MVC, Spring Security, Thymeleaf, Bulma and PostgreSQL. Deployed with Heroku.
I liked this project due to the speed of the html rendering through the server and the seamless transition between frontend and backend thanks to old school SSR.

### Expense Tracker

Created a Full Stack Web App that allows any registered user to add and remove their expenses and spending goals and track them in a monthly basis. Built with the MERN stack and Material-UI. Deployed with Heroku (Serverless).
I kind of enjoyed working on this one, it was challenging but it felt more or less redundant state wise between frontend and backend.
