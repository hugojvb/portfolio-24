<h2>Javascript</h2>

<p>
I worked with Javascript a lot especially in the frontend.
I've been using mainly Next (<em>React</em> metaframework) for more recent apps and Ember for legacy. Also meddled with jQuery, Angular and vanilla Javascript in times.

<p>
In the server side I worked with the *Node* runtime (Express framework) mainly on web services.

## PHP

About ~75% of all web servers use PHP and inevitably most legacy code that I've worked on was in PHP.

Namely with the frameworks Symfony, Code Igniter and Slim, following OOP principles.

## Go

Go is a language that I'm very interested on. In fact, this web site is built with Hugo, a Go framework to build SSG apps.

In my experience, I worked with Go mainly for Web Services using Gin Gonic framework.
