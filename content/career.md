<details id="js">
  <summary class="cursor-pointer flex transitionable hover:opacity-50">
    <h3>Javascript</h3>
  </summary>
  <div class="text-block">
    <p>
      I worked with Javascript a lot especially in the frontend.
      I've been using mainly Next (<em>React</em> metaframework) for more recent apps and Ember for legacy. Also meddled with jQuery, Angular and vanilla Javascript in times.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the server side I worked with the <em>Node</em> runtime (Express framework) mainly on web services.
    </p>

<details id="php">
  <summary class="cursor-pointer flex transitionable hover:opacity-50">
    <h3>PHP</h3>
  </summary>
  <div class="text-block">
    <p>
    About 75% of all web servers use PHP and inevitably most legacy code that I've worked on was in PHP.
    </p>
    <p>
    Namely with the frameworks Symfony, Code Igniter and Slim, following OOP principles.
    </p>

<details id="go">
  <summary class="cursor-pointer flex transitionable hover:opacity-50">
    <h3>Go</h3>
  </summary>
  <div class="text-block">
    <p>
    Go is a language that I'm very interested on. In fact, this web site is built with Hugo, a Go framework to build SSG apps.
    </p>
    <p>
    In my experience, I worked with Go mainly for Web Services using Gin Gonic framework.
